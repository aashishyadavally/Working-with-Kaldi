At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (45,47.9,55) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (45,47.9,55) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (45,47.9,55) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 100.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the -100.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 100.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
